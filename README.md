    Watch:       /Users/me/my/less/
    Compile:     /Users/me/my/less/styles.less
    Target:      /Users/me/my/css/styles.less
    Compiler:   lessc

## Usage

```
Usage: piglet [options] <watch> <source> <target>

    Required Arguments:

    watch: The directory path to watch. Changes to .less
           files in this directory will trigger compilation.

    source: The single source .less file to compile.

    target: The directory path or file path to which piglet
            will compile.

    Options:

    -r --recess: Use recess instead of lessc to compile.
                 Much slower.
```
	
	
## Optionally, add piglet to .bash_profile

If you want to command piglet from any directory add it to your .bash_profile

    nano ~/.bash_profile
    # add thisâ€¦
    export PATH=~/bin:/Users/your/path/to/piglet:$PATH
    source ~/.bash_profile

This will allow you to do this:

    # pwd: /Users/me/my/fabulously/long/path/wordpress/wp-content/themes/blue/assets
    piglet less less/styles.less css
